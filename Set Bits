Given a positive integer N, Count the number of set bits in it. 

Example 1:

Input: N = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = 8
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function setBits() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns the count of number of set bits.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^9

SOLUTION:

class Solution
{
public:
    int setBits(int N)
    {
        // Write Your Code here
     int count = 0; 
while (N) 
{ 
    count += N & 1; 
    N >>= 1; 
} 
return count; 
    }
};
